== Overview

The documents are generated in a Docker-container.
Three scripts are available:

* for html-pages -> build-html-docker.sh
* for slides -> build-reveal-docker.sh
* for pds -> build-pdf-docker.sh

For each output (revealjs, html5 and pdf) a single folder is created.

IMPORTANT: The html-output is generated into a `docs`-folder, so it is published to gh-pages automatically.

=== Necessary Frameworks

For RevealJS the revealjs-folder will be added automatically

== Available scripts

IMPORTANT: Before using the scripts, revisit them carefully.

|===
| script | purpose

| `build-html-docker.sh`
| creates the html-output

| `build-pdf-docker.sh`
| creates the pdf-output

| `build-reveal-docker.sh`
| creates the reveal-output for generating slides

| `download-reveal.sh`
| downloads the reveal-library from the github-repo and unzips the files.
This script is used by `build-reveal-docker.sh`.

| `build-all.sh`
| create the html-, pdf-, and revealjs-output

| `clean-all.sh`
| deletes all output-files, which are #not# necessary for the gh-pages

| `publish-gh-pages.sh`
| creates the html-output and publish it on the gh-pages.

=== The Generated Output

gh-pages need the doc-folder for publishing.
